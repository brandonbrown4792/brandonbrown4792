Welcome to my profile!

I am an electrical engineer turned full stack software developer with strengths in Ruby on Rails, JavaScript, TypeScript, React, NextJS, Git, SQL, HTML, and CSS. I have a passion for learning new technologies, solving complex problems, and collaborating with others.

I have currently learning Python and its MVC framework Django and have been having a blast.ðŸ’¥ With my current expertise in Ruby on Rails, I wanted to learn a more widely used framework, so bring on the learning! ðŸ‘ŠðŸ“•
